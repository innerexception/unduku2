Unduku 2

Monster lairs placed on a pre-generated map
    -Spawns creeps that attack buildings
    -Can be destroyed by preist npc
    -Destroying all lairs completes a map
    -New lairs may be spawned by events
    -Events may cause monster surge

The town starts at your temple
    -Direct where the town should expand
    -Resource nodes under town control grant increased faith, civ level, or expansion
    -If the town encompases a monster lair, a preist will be sent to attempt closure
        -Closure success chance is based off faith and civ level depending on monster type
        -If failed, town retreats one square from the lair and there is a monster surge
    -Send expedition ability?

Faith
    -Level decreases when monsters destroy buildings (at low civ level), 
        or are killed by the people
    -Increases when monsters are killed by you, 
        or you use an ability, 
        or there is a disaster
    -Faith determines what abilities you can use
        -Rain, cause a field to progress
        -Sun, stop a field from progressing
        -Lightening, destroy one unit or building on a tile 
        -Various disasters/plagues: Frogs, Tornado, Pestilence
        -Avatar: bring the statue at the town center to life and use it to fight monsters
    -Faith slowly decreases
    -If faith reaches zero you lose
    -Faith increased by offerings from the people


POC:
1. Render town center. The people will plant fields.
    Render remains of previous empire: ruined roads, fields, buildings
    Resource collectors can be repaired by expansion


2. Render a monster lair of random type.
    Monsters will trickle out and destroy buildings in the town.
    If the town center is destroyed, you lose
    Use Avatar to fight monsters for a big faith boost
    Avatar can be used when faith is high
3. Send rain to make fields grow.
    Once a field is harvested, you can direct the town to be expanded 1 square.
    Rain can be used any number of times. 2x per harvest is enough. 
    Using it too much on an area causes floods.
4. Send earthquake to mountains to make mineral resources appear. 
    Earthquake has a long cooldown.
    Destroys anything nearby.
    Once the town encompases new type of resource they will build a mine.
    Once the mine accumulates 3 stacks the civ level will increase.
5. If civ level is high enough, 
    the people will build defenses every few tiles.
    the people will begin to develop scientific explainations for your powers and using them will no longer grant faith
    lowering the civ level can reverse this effect. 
    the civ level is lowered by loss of resource access, and disasters.
